EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
A quality supplier selection process is considered a cost-reduction strategy in supply chain management. The idea of suppliers as potentially strong partners in shared success is increasing, attracting many researchers' interest. Supplier selection is the strategic procedure businesses use to evaluate and select efficient suppliers to establish a mutually beneficial long-term business-to- business relationship. Supplier relationship management is part of the supply chain design and buying companies can increase their competitive ability by capitalising on their relationships with efficient suppliers. Supplier selection is a multi-choice decision-making problem. When a company has identified the potential suppliers they want to work with, the next step is to define what success looks like for them. The process starts with them establishing input and output criteria. The input criteria are the resources the company employs as a consumer, while the output criteria are the benefits they hope to gain from employing those resources. A specified supplier selection criterion ensures clear expectations for supplier performance. Most companies focus on economic criteria. Also, the triple-bottom-line approach to sustainability is not often considered in supplier selection literature except in cases where “sustainability” or “green” was the topic. A company can minimize the impact of its supply chain by using suppliers who adhere to social and environmental standards.
Powerful supplier selection models such as Machine learning (ML), Mathematical programming(MP) and Hybrid models have been employed in past research in order to choose the best supplier. Deciding on the appropriate model to use has been a challenge. Limited studies use data envelopment analysis-Neural network (DEA-NN) hybrid models to solve supplier selection problems. Only 2% of supplier selection literature has explored the DEA-NN approach. There are some limitations on the part of DEA and NN when used as stand-alone models for supplier selection; DEA models can estimate the efficiency scores of supplier performance and then classify them into efficient and inefficient. The shortcoming is that DEA cannot predict those efficiency scores. In addition, the DEA evaluation process would need to be re-employed whenever a new supplier is added to the list of potential suppliers. Fortunately, the ML models can predict the

efficiency scores because they can be trained using the results of the DEA model. The aim of this research is to develop a DEA-NN supplier selection hybrid model to deal with these limitations. On this ground, we established three focused research objectives in line with a DEA-NN framework that details the hybrid model development process. The framework was made up of DEA and ML stages. Considering that the criteria considered in most DEA-NN supplier selection existing literature did not cover the three arms of sustainability, we started by classifying different supplier selection criteria under each component of sustainability to enable decision-makers to make strategic selections when deciding what Sustainable supplier selection criteria to use. This classification was accomplished by establishing a supplier selection criteria framework after carefully examining and combining current supplier selection criteria. The next step was to select a dataset that adheres to the triple-bottom-line framework from existing literature. In DEA, efficiency is assessed in each situation as a proportional change in inputs or outputs. This study used two DEA models, i.e., CCR, which operates on constant returns to scale and BCC, which operates on variable returns to scale, to extract the CCR-Efficiency and BCC-Efficiency scores. The results showed that the BCC model classified more suppliers as efficient than the CCR model due to scale inefficiency. The DEA efficiency scores become the target variable for the DEA-NN prediction.
This study utilized a NN with a focus on the backpropagation technique. The DEA-NN model initially had a performance of 78.22% when using CCR efficiency scores and 54.01% when using BCC efficiency scores. Then the model was enhanced through three performance improvement methods: adding more hidden layers, using the softplus activation function, and unnormalization. We made efforts to justify the suitability of the model through three steps: first, evaluating the models' performance during each method; second, extracting the DEA-NN results and comparing them with the actual DEA results; Lastly, testing the same models on a larger simulated dataset. Before the simulation, the softplus activation method with 85.05% accuracy provided the highest overall result and also when using the CCR efficiency scores. When using the BCC efficiency scores, the highest result of 78.97% was obtained from the more hidden layers method. The efficiency scores were also lower in the DEA-NN model than in the DEA-CCR model, while the opposite was for DEA-BCC. We extracted the results for further analysis, and the outcome was that the majority of the top suppliers classified as efficient in the DEA model were also classified

as efficient in the DEA-NN model. This is a guarantee that the model was effective. Furthermore, after simulating 2000 supplier information from the parameters of the existing dataset, the models were retrained and tested. This resulted in a general increase in model performance. The highest performance of 89.16% was attained using the CCR efficiency scores- softplus method. The highest performance using the BCC efficiency scores was 76.98% after applying the same softplus activation method.
A major limitation of this study is that supplier performance is confidential, making it difficult to access such data directly. Therefore, we used a small dataset from existing literature and, afterwards, simulated a larger dataset. We created the simulated dataset by using the parameters of the initial small dataset, making it synthetic. A higher performance could have been attained, given that an original large dataset was used.
In summary, this research has proposed a way to deal with the challenging issues with efficient supplier selection in a fast, reliable, and accurate manner while considering the triple-bottom-line framework. Efficient suppliers are those with the highest efficiency scores. Therefore, decision- makers are advised to employ the DEA-NN model to aid their supplier selection decision-making process. It is also important to note that wrong assumptions regarding the effects of economies of scale can affect the efficiency scores of the suppliers under evaluation.
